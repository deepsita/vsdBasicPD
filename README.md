#### Workshop on VLSI/SoC Physical Design concepts mapped with open source tools by VSD.
## Framework of the workshop 
  #### Aim - Learn - Assess - Practice - Bridge the gap - Industry Ready

The workshop is hosted on virtual learning platform called Intelligent Assesment Technology which unlocks the potential of everyone. The course is designed to bring up a solution in bridging the gap of theoretical concepts and practical experience. 
## Bird's Eye view of skills acquired
The workshop starts with an interesting preview of where the actual ISA, Hardware Design, Physical Design stands while designing a complete system. 

With this note, the focus will narrow down to the details of real time SoC Chips. The components of
